## Installation
### Create a Long-Lived Access Token
To talk to the API, you need an "identity card" for your script.
1. Log in to your Home Assistant UI.
2. Click on your Profile (your name/icon in the bottom left).
3. Scroll all the way to the bottom to Long-Lived Access Tokens.
4. Click Create Token, give it a name (e.g., "Python Script"), and copy the long string.
Warning: You will only see this string once. Save it in a secure place.
